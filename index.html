    <title>Heuristic Evaluation of D2L</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Visibility of system status</h1>

<p>When something is submitted in D2L, a submission receipt is sent to the user. This allows the user to see and be notified of the status of their submission.</p>

<h1>Match between system and the real world</h1>

<p>Everything in D2L’s main menu is labeled in clear terms, and if it isn’t, there’s even a glossary that can explain anything that might not be in the user’s vocabulary</p>

<h1>User control and freedom</h1>

<p>If the user makes a mistake, there are two places they can click on to go back to either the homepage of the course or even further back. Both are easily accessible.</p>

<h1>Consistency and standards</h1>

<p>Under the “Communications” tab, the features “Chat” and “Discussion” could be mixed up by the user as they are very similar terms.</p>

<h1>Error prevention</h1>

<p>When submitting an assignment, there are a couple ways a user can go back to prevent accidentally submitting something they might not mean to. Not only can they click cancel the first time, they can go back after hitting “Submit” if they don’t hit “Done”.</p>

<h1>Recognition rather than recall</h1>

<p>Icons used throughout D2L are easily recognizable by the user, such as this letter icon leading to an option allowing users to email their classmates.</p>

<h1>Flexibility and efficiency of use</h1>

<p>There is a quicker way for users to be able to access content on the homepage of a course if they access the content browser feature instead of the content tab at the top.</p>

<h1>Aesthetic and minimalist design</h1>

<p>D2L has a very minimalist design, as most tabs and features consist of one word. The color scheme is simple as well.</p>

<h1>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</h1>

<p>When error messages come up, they explain in detail why and are coupled with a recognizable red error symbol.</p>

<h1>Help and documentation</h1>

<p>A help option is available at the top of the D2L homepage.</p>
